 My name is Douglas Wong. I am currently majoring in Computer Science at Newbury College. I graduated high school in Davis, California and I decided to explore the east coast and come to Boston. I like going out and shoot some nice photos. You can see mostly photos of landscapes and city skylines in my portfolio. I feel more passion about it because it makes me feel very special and I enjoy it...
